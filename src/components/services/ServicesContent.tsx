/**
 * ServicesContent — Client Component
 *
 * INP Optimizations applied:
 * 1. Framer Motion `whileInView` with `once: true` — animations only fire once,
 *    no continuous observer overhead.
 * 2. `viewport={{ once: true, margin: "-80px" }}` — avoids premature triggering.
 * 3. Heavy link grid is pre-rendered as HTML by the Server Component parent;
 *    hydration cost is minimal since there's no local state.
 * 4. All click handlers are native <Link> / <a> — no synthetic event overhead.
